/**
 `URLSessionTaskOperation` is an `Operation` that lifts an `NSURLSessionTask`
 into an operation.
 
 Note that this operation does not participate in any of the delegate callbacks \
 of an `NSURLSession`, but instead uses Key-Value-Observing to know when the
 task has been completed. It also does not get notified about any errors that
 occurred during execution of the task.
 
 An example usage of `URLSessionTaskOperation` can be seen in the `DownloadEarthquakesOperation`.
